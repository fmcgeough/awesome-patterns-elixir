# awesome-patterns-elixir
A curated list of libraries and resources for the Elixir programming language focused 
on Pattern and Anti-patterns.

## Language Documentation 

-  [Anti Patterns in Elixir code](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/code-anti-patterns.html)
  
## Books 

- [Elixir Patterns](https://elixirpatterns.dev/)

## Videos 

- [Gang of None - talk by Jos√© Valim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agkXUp0hCW8)

## Web Pages 

-  [Functional Programming Design Patterns](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/fppatterns/)
- [Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/)

## Research/Papers 

- [Typeed Design Patterns for the Functional Era](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07069)

## Tools 

- [Credo](https://hexdocs.pm/credo/overview.html). a static code analysis tool for the Elixir language with a focus on teaching and code consistency.
- [Dialyzer](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/dialyzer/dialyzer.html),  DIscrepancy AnaLYZer for ERlang programs. Dialyzer is a static analysis tool that identifies software discrepancies, such as definite type errors, code that is unreachable because of programming errors, and unnecessary tests in single Erlang modules or an entire codebase.
- [Dialyxir](https://hexdocs.pm/dialyxir/readme.html) - a wrapper around dialyzer for the Elixir language
